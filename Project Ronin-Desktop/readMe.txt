Author of initial project idea @Lance_Saijin.

ok base idea is an old one i first saw on win 98 and xp. a program that over lays windows and looks like a desk or work space where short cuts can be created and act like opjects that can be moved like notpads on yuor desk at work
I wand to create a cubical within the computer where you can put up stiky notes. design a desk setup and interact with your real operating system using objects in the program.


i am aware that there might already be things like this out there already but i think it will be good practice for me to create an interactive 3d environment.



any comments or help would be appriated
can reach me @Lance_Saijin on twitter best
